# Mortality Cost of Carbon Calculator

This calculator is based on the scientific research of Daniel Bressler (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24487-w). You can use it at https://onnoniem.github.io/carboncalculator/.

CO2 emission factors are taken from https://www.co2emissiefactoren.nl/lijst-emissiefactoren/. We use tank-to-wheel values; the actual emissions are worse because of the well-to-tank values. We may implement that in the future.

The mortality cost as calculated by Bressler only accounts for heat casualties. The real mortality cost is probably higher, because of the effects of particulate matter and other pollution. Also, the emissions of aviation at high altitutes cause more warming than emissions at ground level.
